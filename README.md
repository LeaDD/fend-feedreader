# FEND Feedreader Project

#### Installation

Clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/LeaDD/fend-feedreader) and launch index.html.

#### About

This project is meant to be a primer on the use of Jasmine and the concept of test driven development. Several tests were devised (after the functionality was already built in this case) to confirm the application's basic functionality.

#### Usage

Upon loading the application will display a number of articles. A drop down (hamburger) menu on the left will allow the opening of a 'feed list' which will alow the user to select a different feed, which will contain different articles. Scrolling all the way to the bottom you will see the results of the Jasmine tests. All will provide a basic description of the functionality tested and all should pass (inidcated by text diplayed in green and no error messages).
